All of those libraries are usually available on most of the most common
distributions. Installing these libraries on a recent Fedora, for
instance, is very simple:

    yum install libmicrohttpd-devel jansson-devel

Notice that you may have to `yum install epel-release` as well if you're
attempting an installation on a CentOS machine instead.

On Ubuntu or Debian, it would require something like this:

	apt-get install libmicrohttpd-dev libjansson-dev
